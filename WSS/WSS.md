## Halloran Reading

* notes: 
  * Thesis: 
    Watson and Cricks scientific revolution in the field of Molecular Biology was an arguement structured to support the "habitual patterns"(Edwin Black pg.70) of the scientific comunity. Halloran wishes to convince his audience the scientific community is succeptable to Rhetorical arguements. Further, scientific proofs and theorms may be influenced by the rhetorical persuasiveness of the arguement.
  * Call to action: 
    * Halloran believes "science is itself an increasingly public enterprise"(Halloran pg.81) it is the resposibility of the non-scientific community to read scientific literature and critically analize the arguements from a rhetorical perspective.  

  * Comment on artical:
    * Halloran argues that because science has such an impact on public affairs, the non-scientific public has an responsibility to analize these scientific papers.
    * Hallorans arguement lacks perspective. Halloran claims that people without backgrounds in a scientific field will help social and civic situations by critiquing the scientific literature. Halloran supports this arguement by providing an example of a journalist Horance Judson who wrote what is generally accepted as the most definitive histories of molecular biology. 
      * First this example is not entirely relevent to the arguement Halloran is making. This man was not analizing the validity of scientific articals
