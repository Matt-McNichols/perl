## Halloran Reading

* notes: 
  * Thesis: 
    Watson and Cricks scientific revolution in the field of Molecular Biology was an arguement structured to support the "habitual patterns"(Edwin Black pg.70) of the scientific comunity. Halloran wishes to convince his audience the scientific community is succeptable to Rhetorical arguements. Further, scientific proofs and theorms may be influenced by the rhetorical persuasiveness of the arguement.
  * Call to action: 
    * Halloran believes "science is itself an increasingly public enterprise"(Halloran pg.81) it is the resposibility of the non-scientific community to read scientific literature and critically analize the arguements from a rhetorical perspective.  

  * Comment on artical:
    * Halloran argues that because science has such an impact on public affairs, the non-scientific public has an responsibility to analize these scientific papers.
    * Hallorans arguement lacks perspective. Halloran claims that people without backgrounds in a scientific field will help social and civic situations by critiquing the scientific literature. Halloran supports this arguement by providing an example of a journalist Horance Judson who wrote what is generally accepted as the most definitive histories of molecular biology. 
      * First this example is not entirely relevent to the arguement Halloran is making. This man was not analizing the validity of scientific articals

## public service announcement
  * 2.5-3.5 pages 
  * ![PSA pic] (http://digitalsynopsis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/public-service-announcements-social-issue-ads-27.jpg)

  * Topic: Do not waste paper

  * Intro: 
    * In the civil war, the north sold war bonds via ads in the newspaper. This was a propaganda act to raise support for the war. The ads were paid for by the U.S. government.
    * After the turn of the century, the firs non-government PSAs were produced.
      * ads were run free of charge by the newspaper to raise awareness of horrors of child labor.
    * PSAs had proven very effective and were now used for an array of topics such as womans rights, army recruitment, health risks, and thinking green
    * One key component to the PSA, is the advertisement is funded.
    * A lot of PSAs are pictures:
      * There is a demand for concise and rhetorically effective advertising in order to create a convincing arguement on a budget.
      * The audience for PSAs is very large,
        * not everyone is literate. Many people speak different languages. People are many different ages.
        * pictures are a very universal form of communication

  * Audience is all different ages, social status and mental ability.
    * we can see the audience is first world because the example of paper towels in a bathroom would not be effective for people who are not used to using an american bathroom,
      more specifically paper towel dispensers

  * Thesis: The publisher uses color and juxtaposition to convey the damaging effect of using paper towel when washing your hands.   

  * color:
    * the color represents the state of the world’s forest and wildlife.  
    * green for healthy
    * black for dead
    * also there is full empty connotation

  * draws on real experiences:
    * tries to make a connection to the reader’s life
      * how terrible it is when the paper towel dispenser is empty
