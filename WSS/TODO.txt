* insert addition example
* use hardware design to teach math through a physical representation
    * Allows the teacher to use a consistant analogy for many subjects
    * Build math from the ground up
    * Teach base representation first
    * how are you going to represent values greater than the base representation.
    * How are you going to represent negative numbers
    * Introduce ideas like overflow early because it makes sense in the analogy

    *   Parents love the idea of giving children something to do with computers that
        they see as productive, Mr. Pearce said. “We have any number of parents who say,
        ‘I can’t take my kid playing one more hour of video games,’ ” he said.
        But if the children are exploring coding, the parents tell him, " ‘I can live
        with that all night long.’ ”
